                    To help quickly track our progress on our AI transformation journey, we're using a simple 5-stage approach. 
                    <strong>AI transformation is like learning to ride a bike</strong> - progress is measured by muscle memory and how much you still have to think about "balance" when using AI.
                </p>
                <p class="start-subdescription">
                    Answer a few questions about your team's current AI usage to discover where you are in the transformation journey.
